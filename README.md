## FAQ: Why Are My Points Not Increasing or Different from the Dashboard?

Q: Why aren't my points increasing?
A: The bot fetches the points data directly from the API. If the data returned from the API is the same, then the points displayed in the bot will match the API response.

Q: Why do my points in the bot not match whatâ€™s shown in the dashboard?
A: The bot shows the points based on the data fetched from the API. If there's a discrepancy, it could be due to updates not reflected yet on the API or sync issues. Always check the API response for the most accurate data.

Q: Is the data from the bot always up-to-date?
A: The bot fetches the latest data available at the time of the request. However, if the API has a delay in updating, the displayed points might not immediately match what's on the dashboard.

Q: How can I make sure my points are correctly displayed?
A: Make sure you're using a valid API token and that the API response is returning correct and up-to-date data. If thereâ€™s an issue, try refreshing or re-authenticating the token.
